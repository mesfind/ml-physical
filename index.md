# Welcome to machine learning climate scientists


## Why Python?

Python is a great programming language that is relatively easy to learn and also very easy to read. 

## The Lessons


The data we are using for this lesson are from the Portal Project Teaching Database 

More details about the files we'll use and where to download them are available on the [Setup](setup/) page


> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including the working directory) and how to start a Python
> interpreter before tackling this lesson. This lesson references the Jupyter
> notebook although it can be taught through any Python interpreter.
> The commands in this lesson pertain to **Python 3**.

### Getting Started
To get started with installing Python, follow the directions given in the [Python section of the course Software page](https://mesfind.github.io/ml-climate).
In addition to installing Python on your own computer, you will also need to download the data files used in the tutorials. Details for doing this are found in the [Setup](setup/) page.

### Format

These lessons will provide command line text and code in specific formats.

All commands that are intended to be executed in your Unix terminal will be shown with the `$` prompt. For example:

```
$ cd ml-climate
$ pwd
```

All output from any execution will be shown with a black bar on the side:

~~~
/home/admin/opt/
~~~
{: .output}

All Python code will be given in boxes with a purple bar on the side and in purple text, with no prompt:

~~~
import numpy as np
a = 12
~~~
{: .python}
