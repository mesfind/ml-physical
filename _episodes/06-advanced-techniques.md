## LSTM for Single-Variable Time Series Forecasting

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excel in learning from sequential data, making them particularly useful for time series forecasting. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement an LSTM network to predict future values in a one-variable time series dataset.

We begin by loading necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data manipulation and visualization, along with PyTorch for building and training our neural network model. The dataset we'll use consists of monthly airline passenger numbers, a classic example in time series analysis.

First, we load the dataset and display the initial few rows to understand its structure:

~~~
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
plt.style.use("ggplot")
from torch.autograd import Variable
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
df = pd.read_csv('data/co2_levels.csv')
df.head()
~~~
{: .python}

The dataset comprises two columns: 'datestamp' and '\\(CO_2\\)'. For our analysis, we will focus on the '\\(CO_2\\)' column as our variable of interest.

~~~
    datestamp    co2
0  1958-03-29  316.1
1  1958-04-05  317.3
2  1958-04-12  317.6
3  1958-04-19  317.5
4  1958-04-26  316.4
~~~
{: .output}

Next, we extract the passenger data and visualize it to get an initial sense of the time series trend.

~~~
training_set = df.iloc[:,1:2].values
plt.plot(training_set, label = 'CO2 level')
plt.show()
~~~
{: .python}

This visualization step helps us understand the overall trend and seasonality in the data, setting the stage for building our LSTM model. Through this tutorial, you will learn how to preprocess the data, construct the LSTM network, and evaluate its performance in forecasting future passenger numbers.
