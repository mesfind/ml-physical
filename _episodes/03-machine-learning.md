# Machine Learning Concepts

Machine learning is a field of study that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves


## Types of ML Algorithms

Types of Machine Learning
There are three main categories of machine learning algorithms:

- Supervised Learning: Algorithms learn from labeled training data to predict outcomes. It includes classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting numerical values).
- Unsupervised Learning: Algorithms find hidden patterns in unlabeled data. A common task is clustering, which groups similar examples together.
- Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for actions to maximize performance
