# Machine Learning Concepts

Machine learning is a field of study that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves


## Types of ML Algorithms

Types of Machine Learning
There are three main categories of machine learning algorithms:

- Supervised Learning: Algorithms learn from labeled training data to predict outcomes. It includes classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting numerical values).
- Unsupervised Learning: Algorithms find hidden patterns in unlabeled data. A common task is clustering, which groups similar examples together.
- Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for actions to maximize performance

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing describes the steps needed to encode data with the purpose of transforming it into a numerical state that machines can read. Data preprocessing techniques are part of data mining, which creates end products out of raw data which is standardized/normalized, contains no null values, and more.

### Replacing Null Values 

Replacing null values is usually the most common of data preprocessing techniques because it allows us to have a full dataset of values to work with. To execute replacing null values as part of data preprocessing, I suggest using Google Colab or opening a Jupyter notebook. For simplicity’s sake, I will be using Google Colab. Your first step will be to import `SimpleImputer` which is part of the `sklearn` library. The SimpleImputer class provides basic strategies for imputing, or representing missing values.

~~~
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
~~~
{: python}

Next, you’re going to want to specify which missing values to replace. We will be replacing those missing values with the mean of that row of the dataset, which we can do by setting the strategy variable equal to the mean.

~~~
imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
~~~
{: .python}

The imputer fills missing values with some statistics (e.g., mean, median) of the data. To avoid data leakage during cross-validation, it computes the statistic on the train data during the fit and then stores it. It then uses that data on the test portion, done during the transform. 

~~~
imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3]) #looks @ rows and columns X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3])
~~~
{: .python}
