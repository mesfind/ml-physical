# Setting Up a Python Environment on Windows Command Prompt
---

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up a **Python environment** for machine learning training in **Windows Command Prompt**.

A virtual environment isolates project-specific packages and dependencies, ensuring a clean and organized workflow.

Prerequisites:

- Windows Operating System: This guide assumes you're using a Windows machine.

- Administrator Privileges (Optional): Certain commands might require administrator rights to create directories and install software. Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator" if necessary.

## Steps 

### 1. Open Command Prompt

Open the Command Prompt on your Windows machine. You can do this by pressing `Win + R`, typing `cmd,` and pressing `Enter`.

#### 2. Navigate to Drive D: (replace with your desired drive)
Switch to drive D: by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

`cd D:`

#### 3. Create a New Directory
Create a new directory named `ml_train` or any name you want by typing in the command line and pressing `Enter`:

`mkdir ml_train`

#### 4. Navigate to the New Directory
Change the current directory to `ml_train` by typing the following command and pressing `Enter`:

`cd ml_train`

#### 5. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a new virtual environment named `ml_env` by typing the following command and pressing `Enter`:

`python -m venv ml_env`

#### 6. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment by typing the following command and pressing `Enter`:

`ml_env\Scripts\activate`


#### 7. Upgrade pip (optional)
Upgrade pip (the Python package installer) to the latest version by typing the following command and pressing `Enter`:

`python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`

#### 8. Install Jupyter Notebook
Install Jupyter Notebook by typing the following command and pressing `Enter`:

`pip install notebook`

#### 9. Verify Installation
To verify that Jupyter Notebook is installed correctly, you can start it by typing the following command and pressing `Enter`:

`jupyter notebook`

---
This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser, and you can start creating and running Jupyter notebooks.
Congratulations! You have successfully set up a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook on Windows.
