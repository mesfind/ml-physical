# Installing Python

When installing Python on your machine, you have the option to install it **system-wide** or in a **virtual environment**.

## System-wide: 

Installing Python system-wide may seem like the most straightforward approach, it can lead to several problems:

- **Dependency conflicts**: Installing packages system-wide can result in dependency conflicts with other packages installed on the system, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

- **Version conflicts**: Different projects may require different versions of the same package, which can be difficult to manage when installing packages system-wide.

## Isolated Installation

- **Isolation**: Virtual environments provide an isolated environment for each project, which means that any changes made to one project will not affect the other projects running on the same machine.

- **Dependency management**: Virtual environments allow you to manage project dependencies easily, without conflicting with system dependencies or other projects on the same machine.

- **Reproducibility**: Virtual environments ensure that your project can be easily replicated on another machine with the same dependencies and versions.

- **Flexibility**: Virtual environments allow you to experiment with different versions of packages and libraries.

Use the follwing steps to install python in Virtual environments both in Windows and Ubuntu OS.

**Windows**:
- Setting Up a Environment in Windows Command Prompt  (Python Enviro_Windows_Command_Prompt.md)
- Setting Up a Python Environment on Windows PowerShell  (Python_Enviro_Windows_PowerShell.md)
  
**Linux: Ubuntu**:
- Setting Up a Python Environment on Ubuntu (Python_virtual_Enviro_Ubuntu.md)
